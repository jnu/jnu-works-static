Library defines ORM database accessor classes and other classes for NCAA.

Includes team name normalization helper functions.

A word on database design.

Most of the mappings in the database are many-to-one / one-to-many. In all of
these cases the relationship is defined just once in the many-end of the
relationship. The corresponding attribute in the one-end is defined using
backref.

There is one many-to-many relationship, the map of Squads to Games, which
is managed by the cross-reference table schedule.

The database is richly interconnected with a set of hierarchical structures
for Teams, Players, and Games. Here's the gist of this network:


> Team
    @ Contains vital info about team (name, etc.)
    + Contains a collection of TeamAliases
    
    + Squad (a Team in a particular year)
        @ Contains descriptive info about Squad: season, RPI, etc.
        ^ references parent Team
        + contains a collection of SquadMembers in `roster`
        + contains a collection of Games in `schedule`


> Player
    @ Contains vital info about player (name, height, etc.)
    
    > SquadMember (a Player in a particular year)
        @ Contains vitalish info about player (jersey #, year in college, etc.)
        ^ references parent Player
        + contains a reference to Squad
        + contains a collection of PlayerStatSheets

        > PlayerStatSheet (a Player in a particular game)
            @ Contains performance statistics for a particular Game
            ^ references parent SquadMember
            + references particular Game
            

> Game
    + contains collection of opponents in Game
    + contains collection of PlayerStatSheets for players in Game
    + contains reference to winner
    + contains reference to loser


> TeamAlias
    ^ references team being aliases
    @ contains alternate name of team (e.g., 'Pitt' instead of 'Pittsburgh')
