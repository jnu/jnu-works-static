ncaalib.ratings

Module that implements additional rating / ranking methods for Squads.

Some third-party modules are required. They are as follows:

====================================================================
* PyDEC: A Python library for Discretization of Exterior Calculus
    Authors:    Anil Hirani and Nathan Bell
    Note:       Software available through Google Code
    Url:        http://code.google.com/p/pydec
    Urldate:    2008
    
Note: See also lecture given by Dr. Anil Hirani at NCSU on Applied Topology
in which he demonstrates the NCAA Men's Basketball ranking system used here:

Additionally, this ranking system and a more detailed explanation of the
methodology is available online at http://basketball.cs.illinois.edu/.

======================================================================


Implemented by Joe Nudell in 2013, but uses ideas and methods developed by
others. See third-party module descriptions for details.
