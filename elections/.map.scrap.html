	Apparently a lot of states have official state drinks. What's worse, of the states that have one, the state drink is almost always milk. As a practicing Mormon, Mitt Romney has to drink a lot of milk. Therefore it's logical to assume states whose official drink is milk will vote for Mitt. Nebraska apparently has another official beverage beside milk: Kool-Aid, which also happens to be the other official drink of Mormonism (zing!).
